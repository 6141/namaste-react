# Higher Order Components
A function which takes a component enhances it and returns a component(enhancer )
Example:
Lets say i have a card I want to attach some label on the top for some specific restuarants based on the flag
we can use Higher Order Components in this case
we can create a new component (which takes existing card component as props) and in return gives the new component
