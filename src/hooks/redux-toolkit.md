# REDUX TOOL KIT

* we cannot directly update the slice

* Lets say I have an add button ---> when button is clicked --> action should be dispatched --> which calls a function called Reducer --> which updates the slice of the redux store

* How to read data -- using selector(subscribing to the store ) get the data from slice
* Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
* Build our store and connect our store to our app
* Build slice
* Dispatch actions and write selectors
